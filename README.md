## 🐟 Summary

**This app shows a double-blind join in Snowflake using Streamilt.**
Note that:

1. Streamlit enables **rich, non-trivial interactions** such as generating synthetic
   data from scratch. 
2. [This entire
   app](https://github.com/streamlit/snowflake-double-blind-demo/blob/master/streamlit_app.py)
   required **less than 200 lines of code!**

**This is the magic of Streamlit!** Such interactions cannot be implemented in Retool or
Tableau wihout torturing the underlying abstractins. By contrast, Streamlit presents an
incredibly flexible language for expressing rich data apps in the ML age. 

This is why Streamlit is actively deployed over half the Fortune 50!
